NotTheEnd
=========

The purpose of this mod is bring life to the most unused dimension of minecraft.

NotTheEnd is still under VERY early development and we will make an anouncement in the minecraft/feed the beast forums as soon as we have something worth showing. However, if you somehow tripped on this repository and wish to leave any comments or sugestions you are more than welcome to do so.

On our initial TODO list are:
-Changing The End's terrain to be composed of an evergrowing asteroid bell, instead of just one in the middle.
-Changing The End portal mechanics so that the portals work both ways.
-Chaging the stronghold generation so there are more than 3.
-Changing the Ender Dragon and Ender Crystal mechanics so they respawn.
-Adding Ores and specific vegetation to The End.
-Adding various new End/Endermen/teleport/portal/etc related blocks, items and tools.
